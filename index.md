My name is **Michal Stanke**. In 2018 I graduated from Computer Science at FEE CTU in Prague and now I work for Cisco Systems. I am also a member of [OpenAlt](https://www.openalt.org/o-spolku) and a proud [Mozillian](https://people.mozilla.org/p/mstanke) from the Czech Republic. Mostly I take care of the Czech localization and community activities around [Mozilla.cz](https://www.mozilla.cz/).
